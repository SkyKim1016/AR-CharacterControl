# AR-CharacterControl

I developed a simple AR game app in the VR/AR Specialist program at Champlain College, using Unity the Third Person Controller (RPG type) plugin, Character Rigging , And Google AR Core, and Blender for rigging animations. 
The app allows a character to move and fight against monsters.
